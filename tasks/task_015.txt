- Lighthouse for performance and accessibility testing
- Storybook for component testing and documentation

Test Coverage:
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage for critical components
- Test all API endpoints
- Test all user flows
- Test edge cases and error handling

Documentation:

API Documentation:
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Endpoint descriptions and examples
- Authentication requirements
- Error codes and handling

User Documentation:
- Commentator guide with screenshots
- Keyboard shortcut reference
- Troubleshooting guide
- FAQ section

Developer Documentation:
- System architecture overview
- Component documentation
- Database schema documentation
- Development setup guide
- Deployment instructions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that unit tests cover critical functionality
2. Test that integration tests validate API behavior
3. Verify that end-to-end tests cover all user flows
4. Test accessibility compliance
5. Verify that documentation is comprehensive and accurate
6. Test that API documentation matches actual implementation
7. Verify that user guides are clear and helpful
8. Test that system architecture documentation is up-to-date
9. Verify that test coverage meets targets
10. Test that documentation is accessible to target audiences
