# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Match History and Statistics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality to store, retrieve, and display match history and statistics, with filtering and search capabilities.
# Details:
1. Create API endpoints for match history and statistics
2. Implement filtering and search functionality
3. Develop statistics calculation services
4. Create UI for browsing match history
5. Implement detailed match view
6. Add export functionality for reports
7. Develop data visualization for statistics

API Endpoints:
```
GET /api/matches - Get list of matches with filtering
GET /api/matches/:id/statistics - Get detailed statistics for a match
GET /api/players/statistics - Get player statistics across matches
GET /api/export/match/:id - Export match data (PDF/CSV)
```

Filter Parameters:
- dateFrom, dateTo: Filter by date range
- players: Filter by player names
- teams: Filter by team names
- format: Filter by match format
- status: Filter by match status

Statistics Calculations:
- Total goals per team/player
- Goals by row (if tracked)
- Timeout usage patterns
- Win/loss records
- Average goals per set
- Set duration statistics

UI Components:
- Filterable match list
- Detailed match view with set-by-set breakdown
- Statistics visualizations (charts, graphs)
- Export controls for reports

# Test Strategy:
1. Test filtering and search functionality with various criteria
2. Verify that statistics are calculated correctly
3. Test pagination of match history
4. Verify that detailed match view shows all relevant information
5. Test export functionality for different formats
6. Verify that data visualizations render correctly
7. Test performance with large match history
8. Verify that only authorized users can access certain statistics
9. Test the UI for usability and responsiveness
10. Verify that exported reports contain accurate data

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Database Models and API Endpoints for Match History [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement database models for storing match history and statistics. Create RESTful API endpoints for retrieving match data with filtering capabilities.
### Details:
1. Create/update database models for Match, MatchStatistics, and PlayerStatistics entities with appropriate relationships.
2. Implement the GET /api/matches endpoint with query parameter support for all filter parameters (dateFrom, dateTo, players, teams, format, status).
3. Implement the GET /api/matches/:id/statistics endpoint to retrieve detailed statistics for a specific match.
4. Add pagination support for match listing endpoint.
5. Include proper error handling and validation for all API endpoints.

## 2. Implement Statistics Calculation Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop a service layer that calculates various statistics from match data, including player and team performance metrics.
### Details:
1. Create a StatisticsService class with methods for calculating all required statistics (total goals, goals by row, timeout patterns, win/loss records, etc.).
2. Implement the GET /api/players/statistics endpoint to retrieve aggregated player statistics across matches.
3. Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed statistics to improve performance.
4. Ensure calculations handle edge cases (incomplete matches, forfeits, etc.).
5. Design the service to be extensible for future statistics types.

## 3. Develop Match History UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create UI components for browsing and filtering match history, including a filterable match list and detailed match view.
### Details:
1. Implement a filterable match list component with controls for all filter parameters.
2. Create a detailed match view component showing set-by-set breakdown of match data.
3. Add pagination controls for the match list.
4. Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
5. Add loading states and error handling for API requests.

## 4. Implement Data Visualization for Statistics [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create interactive data visualizations (charts, graphs) to display match and player statistics in an intuitive way.
### Details:
1. Select and integrate an appropriate charting library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js).
2. Implement visualizations for key statistics (win/loss records, goals per set, etc.).
3. Create a dashboard layout to display multiple visualizations.
4. Add interactive features (tooltips, filtering, drill-down capabilities).
5. Ensure visualizations are accessible and responsive.

## 5. Add Export Functionality for Reports [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.4
### Description: Implement functionality to export match data and statistics in various formats (PDF, CSV).
### Details:
1. Implement the GET /api/export/match/:id endpoint to generate exportable data.
2. Create service methods to format data for different export types (PDF, CSV).
3. Add UI controls in the match detail view to trigger exports.
4. Implement client-side or server-side export generation based on performance considerations.
5. Include metadata and formatting in exports to improve readability.
