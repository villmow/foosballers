# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Development Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Vue.js frontend and Node.js/Express backend, configure build tools, and set up the development environment.
# Details:
1. Initialize a new Vue.js project using Vite
2. Configure TypeScript for both frontend and backend
3. Set up Express.js server with basic routing
4. Configure MongoDB connection
5. Set up PrimeVue and Tailwind CSS 4
6. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
7. Set up development, testing, and production environments
8. Create basic project structure with directories for components, views, services, and API routes
9. Configure WebSocket support
10. Set up basic CI/CD pipeline

Code structure:
```
/client
  /src
    /assets
    /components
    /views
    /services
    /store
    /types
    main.ts
/server
  /src
    /controllers
    /models
    /routes
    /services
    /middleware
    /config
    app.ts
/shared
  /types
  /utils
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the development server starts correctly
2. Confirm that the frontend can communicate with the backend
3. Test MongoDB connection
4. Verify that WebSocket connections can be established
5. Run linting and type checking to ensure code quality
6. Test the build process for both development and production environments

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Vue.js Frontend with Vite and Configure TypeScript [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the Vue.js project using Vite as the build tool and configure TypeScript for type safety in the frontend codebase.
### Details:
Run `npm create vite@latest client -- --template vue-ts` to initialize the Vue.js project with TypeScript. Configure tsconfig.json with strict type checking. Create the basic directory structure for the frontend including assets, components, views, services, store, and types folders. Install required dependencies including PrimeVue and Tailwind CSS with `npm install primevue tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`.

## 2. Set up Express.js Backend with TypeScript [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript support and create the basic server structure.
### Details:
Create a server directory and initialize a new Node.js project with `npm init -y`. Install Express and TypeScript with `npm install express typescript ts-node @types/express @types/node`. Configure tsconfig.json for the backend. Create the basic directory structure including controllers, models, routes, services, middleware, and config folders. Set up a basic Express server in app.ts with error handling middleware and CORS support.

## 3. Configure MongoDB Connection and Basic Models [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up MongoDB connection using Mongoose and create basic data models for the application.
### Details:
Install Mongoose with `npm install mongoose @types/mongoose`. Create a database configuration file in the server/src/config directory. Implement connection handling with proper error handling and reconnection logic. Set up a basic schema and model structure. Create a connection utility that can be imported by other parts of the application.

## 4. Implement WebSocket Support and Shared Types [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Set up WebSocket support using Socket.IO and create shared type definitions between frontend and backend.
### Details:
Install Socket.IO with `npm install socket.io` on the backend and `npm install socket.io-client` on the frontend. Configure Socket.IO server in the Express application. Create a shared types directory with TypeScript interfaces that can be used by both frontend and backend. Implement basic Socket.IO connection handling and event structure. Create utility functions for WebSocket communication.

## 5. Configure Code Quality Tools and CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Set up ESLint, Prettier, and a basic CI/CD pipeline for the project.
### Details:
Install ESLint and Prettier with `npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-plugin-vue @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-config-prettier`. Create configuration files (.eslintrc.js, .prettierrc) for both frontend and backend. Set up pre-commit hooks using Husky to enforce code quality. Create a basic CI/CD pipeline configuration using GitHub Actions or similar service with jobs for linting, testing, and building the application. Configure environment variables for development, testing, and production environments.
