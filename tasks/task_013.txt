# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Security Measures and Data Protection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security measures including authentication, authorization, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
# Details:
1. Implement secure authentication with JWT
2. Configure TLS for all network communication
3. Implement CSRF protection
4. Add input validation for all user-provided data
5. Implement rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
6. Configure secure HTTP headers
7. Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage
8. Add audit logging for security events

Security Measures:

Authentication Security:
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt (cost factor 12+)
- JWT with appropriate expiration (90 minutes)
- Secure storage of tokens (HttpOnly cookies)
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts

API Security:
- Input validation using Joi or similar
- Parameterized queries to prevent injection
- Rate limiting using express-rate-limit
- CORS configuration with appropriate origins

HTTP Security Headers:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-XSS-Protection

Authorization:
- Role-based access control
- Resource-based permissions
- Principle of least privilege

Error Handling:
- Custom error classes
- Sanitized error responses
- Detailed internal logging

# Test Strategy:
1. Perform security scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP
2. Test authentication with various scenarios
3. Verify that rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
4. Test CSRF protection effectiveness
5. Verify that input validation prevents injection attacks
6. Test authorization controls for different user roles
7. Verify that HTTP security headers are properly configured
8. Test error handling to ensure no sensitive information is leaked
9. Verify that audit logging captures security events
10. Conduct penetration testing on the application
