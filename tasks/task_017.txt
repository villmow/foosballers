# Task ID: 17
# Title: Task #17: Implement User Authentication UI Workflow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a complete user authentication UI workflow that guides users from the landing page to login, and provides a dropdown menu from the user icon for logout and profile access.
# Details:
This task involves creating a seamless authentication flow with the following components:

1. Landing Page Modifications:
   - Add a prominent login prompt/button on the landing page
   - Ensure unauthenticated users are directed to login
   - Design should be responsive and follow existing design system

2. Login Component:
   - Create a clean, accessible login form with username/email and password fields
   - Implement form validation with clear error messages
   - Add "Remember me" functionality
   - Include "Forgot password" link
   - Ensure secure handling of credentials

3. User Icon and Dropdown Menu:
   - Add a user icon in the top-right corner of all authenticated pages
   - Icon should display user avatar if available or default icon
   - Implement a dropdown menu that appears on click
   - Menu should include at minimum: Profile link and Logout option
   - Add subtle animations for dropdown open/close

4. Profile Settings Page:
   - Create a page where users can view and edit their profile information
   - Include fields for name, email, password change, and other relevant settings
   - Implement form validation and success/error notifications

5. Logout Functionality:
   - Implement secure logout that clears session data
   - Redirect to landing page after logout
   - Show confirmation of successful logout

6. State Management:
   - Ensure proper state management for authentication status
   - Handle session persistence appropriately
   - Implement route guards for authenticated routes

The implementation should follow best practices for UI/UX design, accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1), and security considerations for authentication workflows.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this authentication UI workflow should include:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test individual components (login form, dropdown menu, profile form)
   - Validate form validation logic
   - Test state management for authentication

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify the login flow works end-to-end
   - Test dropdown menu functionality
   - Confirm profile page loads and saves correctly
   - Verify logout process works as expected

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Create Cypress or similar E2E tests for the complete user journey
   - Test from landing page → login → accessing dropdown → logout
   - Test from landing page → login → accessing dropdown → profile → making changes

4. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Run automated accessibility tests (Lighthouse, axe)
   - Perform keyboard navigation testing
   - Test with screen readers

6. Security Testing:
   - Verify authentication tokens are properly handled
   - Test for common security issues (XSS, CSRF)
   - Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in the UI

7. User Testing:
   - Conduct usability testing with 3-5 users
   - Gather feedback on the authentication flow
   - Make adjustments based on user feedback

8. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize load times for authentication components
   - Test performance on lower-end devices

Documentation of test results should include screenshots of the UI at each step of the workflow and detailed reports of any issues found during testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Landing Page with Login Prompt [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the landing page to include a prominent login button and ensure unauthenticated users are directed to the login page.
### Details:
Create a responsive login prompt component that follows the existing design system. Add conditional rendering to display different content for authenticated vs. unauthenticated users. Implement a redirect mechanism that checks authentication status and directs unauthenticated users to the login page when attempting to access protected routes.

## 2. Create Login Form Component with Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a clean, accessible login form with proper validation, error handling, and additional functionality like 'Remember me' and 'Forgot password'.
### Details:
Build a form component with username/email and password fields. Implement client-side validation with clear error messages for invalid inputs. Add 'Remember me' checkbox that stores credentials securely. Include 'Forgot password' link. Style according to design system. Ensure the form handles submission states (loading, success, error) appropriately and securely transmits credentials to the authentication API.

## 3. Implement User Icon and Dropdown Menu [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add a user icon in the top-right corner of authenticated pages that displays the user's avatar or a default icon, with a dropdown menu containing profile and logout options.
### Details:
Create a user icon component that conditionally renders based on authentication status. Display user avatar if available or default icon. Implement a dropdown menu that appears on click with smooth animations. Include menu items for Profile and Logout. Ensure the component is responsive and works across all authenticated pages. Position the icon consistently in the navigation bar.

## 4. Develop User Profile Settings Page [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive profile settings page where users can view and edit their personal information, with appropriate validation and feedback mechanisms.
### Details:
Build a profile page with form fields for name, email, password change, and other relevant settings. Implement form validation for all editable fields. Add success/error notifications for form submissions. Fetch user data from the API and populate form fields. Handle form submission to update user information. Ensure the page is responsive and follows the design system.

## 5. Implement Authentication State Management and Logout Flow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive state management for authentication status across the application and implement a secure logout functionality.
### Details:
Implement a central authentication state store (using the application's state management solution). Handle session persistence with secure storage mechanisms. Create route guards for protected routes. Implement a logout function that clears session data, updates the authentication state, and redirects to the landing page. Add a confirmation message for successful logout. Ensure all authenticated components respond appropriately to authentication state changes.
