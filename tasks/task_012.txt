Create a keyboard shortcut listener service that works across all commentator screens.

Add smooth transitions between light/dark modes. For the feedback system, implement toast notifications for successful actions, error states with recovery options, loading indicators for async operations, and subtle animations for state changes. Ensure all feedback is accessible and not solely reliant on color.
