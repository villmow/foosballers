# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement User Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure authentication system with login, registration, password recovery, and session management for commentators and administrators.
# Details:
1. Create MongoDB schema for users with fields: username, email, password (hashed), role, lastLogin, createdAt, updatedAt
2. Implement password hashing using bcrypt
3. Create authentication middleware for protected routes
4. Implement JWT token generation and validation
5. Create login endpoint with rate limiting
6. Implement password recovery flow with secure email links
7. Create account creation endpoint (admin only)
8. Implement session timeout after 90 minutes of inactivity
9. Create frontend login form with validation
10. Implement password reset form

User Schema:
```typescript
interface User {
  _id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // hashed
  role: 'commentator' | 'administrator';
  lastLogin: Date;
  loginAttempts: number;
  lockUntil: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

Authentication Flow:
1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates credentials and checks account status
3. If valid, server generates JWT token
4. Token is returned to client and stored
5. Token is included in subsequent API requests
6. Server validates token on protected routes

# Test Strategy:
1. Test user registration with valid and invalid data
2. Verify login with correct and incorrect credentials
3. Test password reset functionality
4. Verify account lockout after 5 failed attempts
5. Test session timeout after 90 minutes
6. Verify that protected routes reject unauthorized access
7. Test JWT token validation and expiration
8. Verify that passwords are properly hashed in the database
9. Test administrator ability to create new accounts
10. Verify email notifications for account creation and password reset
