# Task ID: 16
# Title: Task #16: Create Containerized Development Environment with Reset Capability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish a containerized development environment using Docker for all services (MongoDB, frontend, and backend) with the ability to easily reset to a clean state, complete with database seeding and environment-specific configurations.
# Details:
This task involves several key components:

1. Docker Configuration:
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines all services (MongoDB, frontend, backend)
   - Configure appropriate networking between containers
   - Set up volume mappings for persistent data
   - Define environment variables for each service
   - Implement health checks to ensure services start in the correct order

2. Database Seeding:
   - Develop MongoDB seeding scripts to populate the database with test data
   - Create different data sets for various testing scenarios
   - Implement idempotent seeding to prevent duplicate data
   - Add option for minimal vs. comprehensive test data sets

3. Environment Configuration:
   - Create environment-specific configuration files (.env files)
   - Implement configuration for development, testing, and staging environments
   - Document all environment variables and their purposes
   - Ensure sensitive information is not committed to version control

4. Reset Scripts:
   - Develop shell scripts to reset the entire environment
   - Include options for partial resets (e.g., database only, specific services)
   - Add safeguards to prevent accidental resets in production
   - Implement logging for reset operations

5. Documentation:
   - Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
   - Document all commands for starting, stopping, and resetting the environment
   - Include troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Add diagrams showing the architecture of the containerized environment

The implementation should prioritize developer experience, ensuring that new team members can quickly set up and understand the development environment.

# Test Strategy:
Testing this task will involve multiple verification steps:

1. Environment Setup Verification:
   - Have multiple team members follow the documentation to set up the environment from scratch
   - Verify all services start correctly with `docker-compose up`
   - Confirm proper networking between containers by accessing services from each other
   - Validate that environment variables are correctly passed to each service

2. Database Seeding Tests:
   - Execute seeding scripts and verify data is correctly populated
   - Run seeding multiple times to ensure idempotency
   - Validate different data sets are correctly implemented
   - Check that database indexes and constraints are properly applied

3. Reset Functionality Testing:
   - Test the reset script from various starting states
   - Verify partial reset options work as expected
   - Confirm that reset operations are properly logged
   - Ensure reset doesn't affect any production environments

4. Integration with Development Workflow:
   - Verify that local code changes are reflected in the containerized environment
   - Test the development workflow including code changes, database migrations, and resets
   - Confirm that debugging tools work correctly with the containerized services
   - Validate that test suites can run against the containerized environment

5. Documentation Review:
   - Have a new team member follow the documentation without assistance
   - Collect feedback on clarity and completeness of instructions
   - Verify all commands listed in documentation work as expected
   - Ensure troubleshooting section addresses common issues

The task will be considered complete when all team members can successfully set up, use, and reset the development environment following the provided documentation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Docker Compose Configuration for All Services [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a docker-compose.yml file that defines and configures all required services (MongoDB, frontend, and backend) with proper networking, volume mappings, and environment variables.
### Details:
Create a docker-compose.yml file in the project root with the following services:
1. MongoDB service with persistent volume mapping
2. Backend service with appropriate port mappings and environment variables
3. Frontend service with appropriate port mappings and environment variables
4. Configure proper networking between services
5. Implement health checks to ensure services start in the correct order
6. Set up volume mappings for code and data persistence

## 2. Implement MongoDB Seeding Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop a robust database seeding system that can populate MongoDB with test data for different scenarios while preventing duplicate entries.
### Details:
1. Create a 'seeds' directory with JSON or JavaScript seed files
2. Develop a seeding script that connects to MongoDB and inserts seed data
3. Implement idempotent seeding logic using unique identifiers
4. Create different data sets (minimal and comprehensive)
5. Add command-line options to select which data sets to seed
6. Integrate seeding into container startup process

## 3. Configure Environment-Specific Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create environment configuration files for different deployment scenarios (development, testing, staging) with appropriate variable definitions and security measures.
### Details:
1. Create template .env files for each environment (.env.development, .env.testing, .env.staging)
2. Define all required environment variables with documentation comments
3. Implement a mechanism to load the correct environment file based on NODE_ENV
4. Create a .env.example file with dummy values for documentation
5. Add .env files to .gitignore to prevent committing sensitive information
6. Document the purpose and expected values for each environment variable

## 4. Develop Environment Reset Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Create shell scripts that allow developers to reset the entire environment or specific components to a clean state with appropriate safeguards.
### Details:
1. Create a main reset.sh script in the project root
2. Implement options for full reset or partial resets (--all, --db-only, --frontend, --backend)
3. Add confirmation prompts to prevent accidental resets
4. Include environment detection to block execution in production
5. Implement logging of reset operations with timestamps
6. Add database backup option before reset
